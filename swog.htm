<p class = "paraStuff">Swig was another founding member of CGC, and has always been one of the more analytical players. He has a keen eye when it comes to noticing players habits and mistakes and has helped to improve the skill level of many of our players. Fair warning, if you ever ask him for advice he’s never going to sugarcoat it and he’ll always tell it to you straight, but sometimes that’s exactly what we need to hear. He has been an Audio Engineer during his time at UT and if you want to listen to some of his music, click the picture below to visit his Soundcloud. He is also graduating this semester, however he will still be in the area so we can still beat him in bracket.
