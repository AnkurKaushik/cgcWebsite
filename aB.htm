<p class = "paraStuff">Since Ab joined UT in 2017, he’s consistently been near the top of the standings. After Ken was released he was quick to pick both him and Chrom up as mains (both of whom are echo fighters of his characters from Smash 4). At any given moment, you can assume Ab is playing Fire Emblem Heroes or some other game within the franchise. With a solid neutral and great punish game, Ab can beat you in or out of Smash. His smash skills have been demonstrated to the world of crew battles as he has taken down the likes of Megafox, one of Texas’ highest ranked players. Additionally, Ab is the leader of his very own church with a cult following. Some say his members are extremely devout and hold him in high regard. He will also be missed as he is graduating and moving on to bigger and better things (hopefully).
