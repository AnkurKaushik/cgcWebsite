<p class = "paraStuff">You can tell that StudZ is really feeling himself when he goes for Yoshi things and they just work. Don’t underestimate him; he has some big wins under his belt (if he doesn’t know who they are) like SparK, A&M’s best player and Bonren, a top Houston player. He’s also a force to be reckoned with in crews, managing to take 17 stocks in PR vs The World. If you see him in bracket, you might catch him holding a Yoshi plush for good luck. He has a positive attitude, believing that he “needs to be the one to carry Yoshi, not the other way around”. He claims that his Meta Knight is “kinda nasty” but this has only been seen in friendlies and not to the same extent that he believes. Studz has been a valuable asset to the CGC admin team and we’re lucky to have him and all he does for us, whether it’s using his “booming voice” for calling matches or helping out with vods. And of course, all hail the BODEEM-HA!
