<p class = "paraStuff">A master tactician who is always 3 steps ahead of the competition. He is one of the friendliest people you will ever meet - out of bracket that is. In game he is ruthless and can punish even the slightest opening or habit. Be wary when he catches one of his own items, because he’ll take you on a combo ride to the blast zone. He is also a part of the CGC crew battle team, managing to take out Orex, another top Texas player on an even playing field. He is known for being annoyingly humble post-set, where he’ll hit you with the “You played so well!” after destroying all of your stocks and taunting mid-game. He claims they’re all misinputs, but this has yet to be confirmed. Once he actually starts practicing this game outside of tournament, he’ll be sure to shake things up in the next season.</p>
