<p class = "paraStuff">He is a Melee god apparently but he hasn’t beaten any of us in Melee with Inkling, so we can’t be too sure about that. He had nearly perfect attendance towards the start of the season, but has spent the more recent weeks practicing for the National Melee Arcadian, where he placed 5th overall. He seems to collect fanboys wherever he goes, whether he actively tries to look for them or not. His Smash Ultimate character pool is pretty solid and has led to him winning a squad strike tournament. We are unsure whether Albert will be joining us for another semester for Ultimate or will be sticking to Melee, but whatever his decision is, we wish him the best of luck.</p>
