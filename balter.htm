<p class = "paraStuff">Waltz was one of the founders of CGC and has contributed not only his time, but also his TV’s and knowledge to keeping the org afloat. He has recently shaken off his “2nd place curse” and has gone on to win multiple UT tournaments and even some Austin tournaments. His Megaman is quite strong due to other players having matchup inexperience and because Waltz wakes up every morning and says to himself: “Megaman is the best character in this game.” Waltz has additionally secured a partnership with Yerba Mate for CGC leading to his world famous phrase, “that’s a Yerba moment!” Waltz also believes Yoshi to be an amphibian, whatever that means. If you ever walk anywhere with Waltz, you’ll notice that he seems to know everyone, not a few people here or there, but actually everyone you pass by.</p>
