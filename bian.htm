<p class = "paraStuff">Minus has been a dominant force ever since he joined the UT smash scene years ago. His adaptability has lead him to many bracket resets and victories over the season, much to the dismay of everyone watching. Minus was also the treasurer of CGC, assisting in the financial decisions for the club. He is also famous for the phrase he coined: “The more I win, the more I win.” Minus has never been to a tournament on a Saturday, but makes up for it by either winning or placing top 4 at every tournament of ours that he attends. He is a valuable member of our crew battle team and even though he couldn’t attend our most recent event, he was there in spirit and played a vital part in our teams success.</p>
