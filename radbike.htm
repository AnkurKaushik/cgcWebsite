<p class = "paraStuff">MadIke is famously known for his airpods, which he can be seen wearing at any time of the day, anywhere. There are many moments when people call out to him but he is blissfully unaware, as he cannot hear once he has them in. His Ike is formidable and he has his confirms down (for the most part), nearly taking a set off of Lunchables, a well known DFW player. Although he fervently stated that his previous main, Donkey Kong, was “trash”, he has recently seen the light and is starting to practice him again. MadIke is hoping for a summer “level up” and seeks to improve in order to take down his rivals at UT. </p>
