<p class = "paraStuff">One of our newest players and our current hidden boss, Matt has taken down the likes of Talon and StudZ, as well as Psyche in an Austin tournament. Had Matt attended a few more of our tournaments, he would be in consideration for PR. His Greninja is quite strong and if you’re not careful he can go “sneako mode” on you, where he catches you with his shadow sneak and potentially ends the stock. Matt is also graduating this semester, and although he was only with us for a short time, he will definitely be missed next year.</p>
