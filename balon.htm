<p class = "paraStuff">Talon has been our jack-of-all-trades administrator for the past few years, helping solidify the CGC’s foundation and encouraging others to step up and help out. One of his greatest achievements has been making “The Video” every year, showing off the highlights of our players throughout the season. He has also offered his digital art and design skills (or lack thereof <3) and made most of our logos thus far. Even though he plays “the worst character in the game”, he has still made waves in the UT scene, going so far as finishing 1st at All Star this season. He has also been our crew battle hero, counter picking his opponents to Battlefield and watching them squirm as he up-airs them to oblivion. Watch out for his fireballs and up-smashes, because after you lose to them he’ll probably complain about them after the set. Even though he’s graduating this year, the CGC will surely miss him and won’t forget the footprint he’s left behind.
