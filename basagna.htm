<p class = "paraStuff">Arguably our fastest improving player of the top 10, lasagna has emerged from casual to competitive in a matter of months. Since Ultimate came out, he made the switch to Roy, a 	beneficial shift as soon after he made top 25 at a 200+ person tournament. His growth has surprised us all, going from SD-ing offstage every match to tearing through Austin local tournaments with his clearly mid tier character (and only SD-ing every other match). Lasagna is also always asking for advice and practices outside of tournament, contributing to his already exponential progress. At nearly any point of the day, he can be spotted in your local grocery store freezer aisle. He is also the most likely to be mistaken for a freshman.
