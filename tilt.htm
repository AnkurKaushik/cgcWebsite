<p class = "paraStuff">When Coach puts his hand on your shoulder, looks you in the eye, and states that “you’re the lynchpin to our team,” you know you’ve made it. Tilt has been an integral part of the CGC since its foundation, always taking on more responsibility and offering to review matches for up-and-coming players. While he’s been attending tournaments less and giving his time to helping commentate matches more, his Bowser is still no slouch and he can still be seen taking W’s during friendlies. When he roasts your gameplay hard, it’s most likely because he believes in you and wants to push you to greater heights. In the next year he will be taking charge of the Competitive Gaming Club, and great things are to be expected of him.</p>
