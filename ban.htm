<p class = "paraStuff">Nitron is straight cheese. Whether he’s on his first or last stock, he will still go for an insanely risky play to try to style on you (although this has failed him many times in the past). Even though his main is Wolf, his Captain Falcon is quite formidable and can easily knee you if you aren’t careful. He has been a part of this group from the start migrating over from his Smash 4 Mario. He is always seen playing mobile games regardless of his phone’s battery level or asking if people want to join him for Minecraft in the middle of the night. As such, he was given the title “Mobile Gamer”. Additionally he claims to rarely use his “Bevo Bucks”, and only for the purposes of “printing money or getting Wendy’s”.
