<p class = "paraStuff">If you haven’t seen him in person, one word to describe him is “Menacing”. You should keep an eye out for his Snake play, because it’s been rapidly improving ever since he switched over from Roy. In order to practice this, he has begun to use Snake’s dash attack in real life, as well as sporting the bandana over his face. He has also been rumored to use down air out of shield in real life as well, but no one has seen it yet. Xeylion has been managing CGC’s stream for the past few months and has also designed layouts, as well as taking an active role in producing vods after tournaments. With him doing all this as a freshman, CGC is lucky to have him - and his snake - for another few years.</p>
