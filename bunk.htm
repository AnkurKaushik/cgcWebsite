<p class = "paraStuff">One of CGC’s most unpredictable players, Junk has a move named after him known as the “Junk Dunk,” where he’ll throw out the up-B off stage and sometimes spike you to the blast zone. He is a local celebrity among the Austin crowd as he plays Dedede, and has had several upsets on top players such as Gidy. Another notable moment for him was his set vs Austin’s best player, Hakii. Junk took him to game 5, and even though he lost gave Hakii a run for his money. Junk has accumulated several clips on “Yeet Smash” and holds the current record at UT for most Yeet Smash clips. He is very adamant about going for high risk plays and justifies them with his signature phrase “but if that hit tho”.</p>
